ZMQ communication demo
======================

Service and application can be started either way.
The solution proposed here wait the application to be ready (in case of), and
handle port binding conflict.

It also demonstrate a protocol based on recv/send multipart, first arg
as the command, etc.

The application starts a server socket for responses.
This service starts a server socket for receiving command.

The startup protocol is this:

1. the application create the response socket
2. the application start the service
3. the application wait on the response socket to know on which port
   the service is running at
4. the application can send message on the service port
